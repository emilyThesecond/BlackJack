# BlackJack
## Description
Blackjack is a card game where the objective will be to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible.
***
## How to play
To start, the dealer will deal two cards per player. You will only see one of the dealers cards. Depending on what your cards add up to, you will decide whether you want to choose Hit or stand. If Hit is chosen, the dealer will deal you another card, if the sum of the cards is over 21, you will automatically loose. If the sum of your cards is less than 21 you can choose to hit again, or stand. If you stand, the dealer will reveal their card and if their sum is closer or equal to 21, they win.
